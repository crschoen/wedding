        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">Rachel went in to the 1-Hour Photo Center at her neighborhood Walgreens to have pictures developed but when it only took 5 minutes, she knew he was The One. Just kidding! The excellent customer service from the cute photo tech did catch her eye though. Despite her mom's warnings about how expensive Walgreens was, Rachel found herself going back again and again just to catch a smile from Chris.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">He caught on and they had their first date on the winter solstice, also falling on&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;">the evening of the first total lunar eclipse in almost 3 years.</span></p>
    <p>
