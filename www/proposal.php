        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">The world had interpreted Mayan carvings to mean that the world was set to end on Friday, December 21, 2012 - the winter solstice and also Rachel and Chris's 2 year anniversary.</span></span></p>

        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>The Kidnaping</strong></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">To start the evening out, while he was driving home from work, Chris had his mother pick Rachel up from her apartment and "kidnap" her! Rachel was suprised to see that she had "kidnapped" Chris's father as well! As she drove them West, Ms. Beverly had them put towels over their faces so that they wouldn't see that they were approaching Pearland Regional Airport.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>The Sunset Helicopter Tour of Downtown</strong></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><img alt="" src="/img/helicopter.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: right; width: 200px; height: 150px;">Mr. Paul and Rachel were both incredibly suprised to find out that Chris had booked a sunset hellicopter tour of Downtown Houston for three (they were celebrating Mr. Paul's birthday, too!) It was the first time to be in a hellicopter for both Mr. Paul and Rachel, but Chris, thanks to his time in the Baylor Institute for Air Science, felt right at home!</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">They flew above the cars stuck in rush hour traffic, going 110 faster than the poor cars! They saw all of the great sights of Downtown, the William's Tower, The Galleria, The Houston Zoo, Miller Outdoor Theater, City Hall, Discovery Green, Toyota Center, Minute Maid Park, everything! This was an extra special tour subject because Chris and Rachel had A LOT of memories of exploring Downtown together - a location where their relationship had really grown through their adventures. They even got to see Christmas lights popping on while flying over the neighborhoods on the way home.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>The Playlist</strong></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">After landing, Chris and Rachel parted ways with his parents and Chris pointed his truck back towards Downtown Houston, but not after flipping on the playlist of 24 special songs, 1 for every month that Chris and Rachel had been dating.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>The Dinner</strong></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><img alt="" src="/img/dinner.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: right; width: 200px; height: 150px;">They drove towards the city skyline but Chris was still keeping Rachel in the dark about where they'd be going next for dinner. She figured that it would be easy to tell where they would go, she knew most of the streets and venues like the back of her hand thanks to their exploration. But after passing City Hall, she was beginning to be in unfamiliar territory when Chris pulled into the <span class="st">Hyatt Regency Houston's valet parking and told the attendant that they had 7:00 pm reservations for the Spindletop restaraunt.</span></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">The Spindletop is Downtown Houston's only revolving rooftop restaurant - one that Rachel had absolutely no idea was there. It brought back great memories of her trip to Australia and the special experience that she'd had at the Sydney Tower Buffet - the only revolving rooftop restaraunt that she ever expected to experience.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">After arriving at the 34th story of the Hyatt, Chris and Rachel enjoyed champagne and a lovely dinner while enjoying the holiday-lit city scenery that passed them. Two other couples got engaged while Rachel and Chris enjoyed the evening there, but Chris had secret sweeter ideas in mind.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Not All Who Wander Are Lost... But Chris Was</strong></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><img alt="" src="/img/wortham.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: right; width: 200px; height: 150px;">Rachel and Chris left the hotel with light hearts, Rachel expecting nothing more from the night, but Chris told her that there was something he'd been passing on his way to work every day that he'd like to show her.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">They drove around, enjoying the music Chris had prepared, until Chris admitted that he was lost. The two did end up finding the Gus and Lyndall Wortham Park in the Medical Center - a small park between roads with cascading waterfalls and dancing fountains that were lit beautifully.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">Chris finally gave up the secret about where they were going because he knew that Rachel was familiar with the place, and they found their way to The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston - a place that they'd been planning on visiting together for a very long time but had never been able to get around to. The Museum of Fine Arts holds a special place in Rachel's heart thanks to great memories and her love of art. It was really romantic that Chris wanted to share it with her that night.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>Party Like There's No Tomorrow</strong></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><img alt="" src="/img/maya.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: right; width: 100px; height: 100px;">Why go to a fine arts museum past 9:00 pm? The Museum was throwing a Mayan themed Mixed Media "End of the World" Party! It was a high energy, late night party with live music, crazy DJ's, dancing, live painting, names written in Maya Hieroglyphics. Rachel and Chris danced and explored the galleries of treasures from the Mayan Empire in the Glassell Collection.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">On the drive back to Clear Lake, Chris left Rachel thinking that the night couldn't have been more perfect.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">The backseat driver that she usually is, Rachel suggested to Chris to take a specific exit to get to her apartment without hitting traffic. Chris breezed on past, leaving Rachel a little confused. She was even more confused when he popped on his turn signal into a shopping center and said "I have to do something really quick, ok?"</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">He parked infront of La Madeline, the restaraunt where they'd had the first part of their first date, and told her to put her shoes back on. She asked if they were going to be robbing the James Avery next door to the restaraunt and he laughed and got out of the truck and came around to open her door and help her out.</span></span></p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;"><strong>The Ring</strong></span></span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">&lt;for Chris to write&gt;</span></span></p>
